# A-Comprehensive-Anti-Theft-Vehicle-Protection-framework-using-embedded-Electronics-and-Python
The project "A Comprehensive Anti-Theft Vehicle Protection Framework Using Embedded Electronics and Python" is an advanced vehicle security system that combines biometric authentication, sensor-based theft detection, and real-time communication. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control components like a fingerprint sensor, vibration sensor, GPS, GSM, camera module, buzzer, and LCD display.

When unauthorized access is attempted, the system triggers alarms, captures the intruderâ€™s image, and sends it via email. Simultaneously, GPS coordinates are sent via SMS, and the vehicle can be remotely immobilized. This multi-layered approach ensures high security through real-time monitoring and remote control, offering a smarter solution to modern vehicle theft.
